# FI Income


## Technologies To Use
I plan to use the following for this application are: PHP, JavaScript, jQuery. That could change to include other libraries in the future.

It is my goal to continue to add content to this application till it reaches completion as set forth in the goals/milestones.


## Bugs and Issues
Feel free to add issues for new features and or bugs. As I look at them I will decide where to place the issues. Some could be placed in the current milestone, but more than likely new features will be placed in a future milestone to prevent scope creep.


## Production
As Milestones are accomplished and reached the code will be moved to the production repository. From their the latest code will be uploaded to the FI Income website for use by all FI Income members.
